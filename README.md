# Topological-Sort
This is a project for my Spring 2016 Data Structures and Algorithms class. It implements a topological sort for various data types.

A full description of the assignment is available in DSTopologicalSortLabDescription.pdf

There were multiple implementation options for different grades. I did the 'B' option.

generictopologicalsort.ads is the specification for the generic topological sort.

generictopologicalsort.adb is the implementation of the generic topological sort.

topsortb.adb is the implementation of the main lab, using generictopologicalsort.

The Input and Output files are the inputs and outputs for the different data sets given to us by the professor.
